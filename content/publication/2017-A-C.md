title = "Multi-scaled heterogeneous deformation behavior of pearlite steel studied by in situ neutron diffraction"
abstract = "Heterogeneous deformation of Fe-0.8 mass%C pearlite steel was studied using in situ high-resolution neutron diffraction during tensile deformation, characterized by the superposition of multi-scaled stress partitioning behaviors between the ferrite and cementite phases (phase stress), 〈hkl〉-oriented grain families with respect to the tensile direction (intergranular stress), and colonies with different lamellar alignments (colony stress). The colony stress was evaluated by analyzing profile asymmetry. The influence of lamellar spacing on such stress partitioning was clarified, and large peak broadening of cementite was also determined in a deformed specimen."
